#AuthAppMockUp This is a mock up that could log user in and out. They can also use this app to retrieve some datas from a database and write some datas to the database. Moreover, they have the power to modify and and delete the datas. In this app, I made it looked like a contact app which retrieve name and phone number. With a little bit of modification, you can make it as whatever data you want to retrieve.
